# Clipboard Agent
A collection of terminal commands and shell scripts designed to make agentic coding possible without the use of rate-limited APIs or proprietary software.

## Who is this for?
Clipboard Agent is for people who want to use the power of AI to help code, debug, and implement features in their projects without worrying about rate limits, subscriptions, or data collection. We offer full transparency in what we do (our project is fully open source!).

## Why Shell Script?
Easy integration, minimal setup, works on nearly every machine, small file size. No need to worry about updating or using package managers.

As an added benefit, you see (and hopefully understand) exactly what you are adding to your project.

### Easy integration
Use a one-liner in the terminal for one-time use, just like npx!

Or add simple one-file copy-paste shell script into your project.

No dependencies. Nothing installed. Just terminal commands.

### Customizability
Nearly every operating system has a scripting functionality. If our scripts do not work on your machine, change it! Its simple enough to modify.

Customize the prompt. Our website can generate a script specific to you.

Want more? Add it yourself! The code is open-source. It is just one file of code.

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute or open issues for this project.

Be aware that this is my first open-source project, so I probably won't manage this project well (if I even manage it at all after this weekend).
