# Clipboard Agent

A collection of terminal commands and shell scripts designed to make agentic coding possible without the use of rate-limited APIs or proprietary software.

## Who is this for?

Clipboard Agent is for people who want to use the power of AI to help code, debug, and implement features in their projects without worrying about rate limits, subscriptions, or data collection. Our project is fully open source.

## Why Shell Script?

Easy integration, minimal setup, works on nearly every machine, small file size. No need to worry about updating or using package managers.

As an added benefit, you see and understand exactly what you are adding to your project.

### Easy integration

Just one file needed. No installation. No extra dependencies needed.

### Customizability

Nearly every operating system has a scripting functionality.

Customize the prompt on our website.

Feel free to add more features.
